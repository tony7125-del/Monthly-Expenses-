# 🧾 Monthly Expenses Breakdown

This project contains a simple Python/Jupyter notebook that displays and summarizes monthly expenses.  
It was created as a basic practice exercise for Python variables, printing, and formatting output.

- **Monthly expenses notebook** (`Monthly expensinses.ipynb`)
  - Stores monthly cost values such as rent, transport, data, fuel, and clothing.
  - Prints a formatted summary of all expenses.
  - Shows the current account amount before expenses.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- Jupyter Notebook

## ▶️ How to Run the Notebook
1. Download or clone the repository.
2. Open the notebook using:
   - Jupyter Notebook  
   - JupyterLab  
   - VS Code with Python + Jupyter extensions
3. Run all cells to view the expense report.

## 📊 Example Output
The script prints a clear breakdown of:
- Current account balance
- Individual monthly expenses
- Total expenses (if calculated)
